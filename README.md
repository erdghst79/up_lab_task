Test Assignment for UpLab Boot Camp 3
## Overview
Welcome to the UpLab Boot Camp. This is the test assignment for you to get your brains prepared before the course. The number of places is limited, so the purpose of this test assignment is to choose the best candidates that are able to understand and complete tasks of different complexity.

The test assignment is a simple todo list application that allows you to create your own list that is saved in your browser memory. 
The application is supposed to perform the following actions:
- add a new task
- set a due date for a task
- see a list of todos
- mark todo as completed
- remove todos
- see all the todos along with completed
- use categories to group todos

### Structure of the assignment
In the daily life, programmers should fix bugs before adding features. Who is willing to use an application full of bugs, but with tons of features? That's why it is mandatory to complete all the bugs from the list.

Tasks list is a list of new features that should be added to the working application. It should allow you to choose an order, pick only the features that you can implement. Even one implemented task counts, but we will pick students among the ones who get the most points.
__Please take a note that different tasks have different number of points__.

__Important__: partial task solution doesn't count. Solutions with critical bugs don't count - test your code.

## How to work on your assignment

1. Create a __private__ mirror of this repo in your GitHub account to avoid exposing your code and invite `brmk` as a collaborator (Settings -> Collaborators). You can learn how to do it here: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/
2. Setup your environment (please see Environment section for versions in the end of this file)
3. Install npm dependencies with command `npm i` or `yarn`
4. Start the app `npm run start` or `yarn start`
5. Please try to have 1 commit per task/bugfix. When you complete your task, do not forget to mark it as completed in the list below. Just put an `x` into the checkbox between braces ( `- [ ]` - unchecked, `- [x]` - checked ).
6. Do not forget to constantly push your changes.
7. When you finish your assignment, please send an email to ihor@uplab.io with the link to your GitHub repo and a list of finished tasks.

We only accept your assignments in the GitHub. Do not send us any zip archives with your projects!
